GOlang backed Web desktop application. CRUD intensive
This is my personal learning project. My current main target is to learn best practices about structuring large scale project.
So I do research SCSS, Routing, Templating and other stuff first.

This repo is for my personal reference.

//2018-03-25 Currently stopped any development and diving into Kubernetes world. Feeling really excited because this is the true way I want to manage my application.
Currently my target is to understand how to manage own Kubernates cluster, to deploy some applications in 3 modes - Dev, Stable and Edge. Then i want to understand how to run gRPC services on top of Vitess. I want fully separate my client from data layer and i would like to understand is it possible to isolate API from data source so i could change database later without heavy API redesigning.
Next thing will be something like static content CDN (JS, CSS, IMAGES).
And after that i need to learn how to do UI composition so i could develop stand alone modules and plug them as i need, to compose whole UI.
